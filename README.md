# macarthur-park-website
Website for MacArthur Park Homeowners Association

I designed this website for use by the MacArthur Park Homeowners Association. The website is not active. It was never commissioned, rather taken on as a personal, "Can you do it" style of project. I built this website from scratch, borrowing elements and how-tos from W3Schools.
